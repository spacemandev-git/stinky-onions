For the purposes of creating a viral marketing campaign for oniondao, we can create a simple game with a prize pool that explains how futarchy works. This accomplishes two goals with one combined project.

Players of this game will login with their Twitters and be given some starting capital (fake USDC) and the ability to roll a random event once every 8 hours that gives them a random amount of new USDC (like working their “job” or hitting 100x on a memecoin, etc).

They can use this USDC to participate in a presale on \$STINKY which is the token used in the game. STINKY governs the aiOnionDAO, and is used to vote on decision markets on what proposals the DAO should undergo. Proposals are randomly generated by an automated Game Master (LLM). Each proposal usually costs some amount of $ from the DAO treasury, and results in some return based on how many attendees enjoyed it an previous history of events and mixes.

Players trade proposals, then based on attendees at the event, NAV either goes up (more ecosystem value created from attendee satisfaction) or it goes down (ecosystem value destroyed from attendee dissatisfaction).

At the end of a number of proposals, players with the largest P&L win the prize pool.
